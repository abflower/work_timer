# work_timer
A flask timer discretely open in the browser tells you how much has passed of a given period of time

Want to know how long you have left of your working day? 
Need to keep an eye on how much time you have left to do something?

This timer is a simple flask application, with purposedly super low key graphics.
In the first screen you are asked to input start and finish time in 00:00 format.
In the actual timer page a purely ASCII progress bar shows the progress and percentage is also given.

Excellent if you don't want to attract unwanted attention.

But if you want to know where you are you don't even need to look at this tab! 
The percentage of progress is also shown in the tab title, giving you access to constant update.
